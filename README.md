AIC is a software platform that provides connectivity for devices and instruments.
Its first project will focus on Automated Testing of PIC wafer/chip.
At the fisrt stage(2023.05.01-2024.04.30), an open source GUI front-end based on 4 basic functions will be created.
---- ---- ---- ----
1. Motion Components: 4 6-DOF assemblies(fiber&probe), Chuck(wafer/chip), Top&Side Camera(Positioning of fiber&probe's tip), Displacement Sensor, MotionCaliTool, RFCaliTool
2. Computer Vision: CV functions&examples
3. Instruments: Keysight(LMS&LCA), Tektronix(SourceUnits&Oscilloscopes&SignalGenerators), Viavi(Map), Santec(TunableLaser), Yokogawa(OSA)
4. Database: Data fitting and visualization(WG&MMI&MRR, etc. Common PIC devices), wafermap, diemap
---- ---- ---- ----
Manipulate all motion assemblies and instruments, edit test processes, process raw data, and generate maps in the GUI front-end.

The principal goal: reduce the cost of passive devices to $0.2/pc and the cost of active(RF) devices to $1/pc. (Maybe less)
